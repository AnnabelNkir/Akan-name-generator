# Akan name generator

#### This is a web application that generates ghanian Akan names based on the day the user was born and their gender.
```Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. This app takes a user's birthday on the form provided and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. This app will take in a user's year of birth, month of birth, day of birth and select gender. Using a formula assigned to a variable in the akan.js file (dayOfWeekNumber), it will be possible to determine the exact day of the week the user was born and give them an Akan name based on their gender.```

2.The user inputs their gender and their birthday in the form

3.On clicking submit, the web app calculates: 

i) The day of the week the user was born based on their birthday.

ii) The user's possible Akan Name based on their gender and the day of the week they were born.

The app then reveals to the user their result which includes:
